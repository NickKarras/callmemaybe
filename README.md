This is where I will periodically post signed messages, for those who want to be very sure they are mine. (Thank you for the inspiration, @drwdal.) If you know how to verify a PGP signature, you'll find it below. If you're a novice and want to get in touch securely: bring a blank thumb drive to a library computer and browse to gellman.us/pgp. It has all the instructions you need.

I am digitally signing this message for people who like to be extra careful. After three years of writing about the NSA and Ed Snowden, I am one of those people too.

I am in full control of my Twitter account, and the tweet linked here is mine: https://twitter.com/bartongellman/status/760841244704669697. 

You may verify my key and signature at gellman.us/pgp and https://keybase.io/bartongellman. 

I'm writing a book for Penguin Press called DARK MIRROR: Edward Snowden and the American Surveillance State. I want to hear from anyone who has first-hand information on either. It need not be some deep dark secret. I'm interested in your observations about Snowden's work and work habits at CIA, Dell, NSA and Booz; or his time in the Army; or in computer training courses; or the surveillance programs and practices he described. Agree with him or not, I'd like to hear from you. I am well aware that reaching out could be risky for you, even without a word of classified conversation. I will strictly follow your preferred opsec protocols. If you want to take precautions and don't know how, go to a library computer and read gellman.us.pgp. 

Also, if it matters to you, note that @snowden supports my request: https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/760871702259695616.
