Here's where I'll PGP-sign messages for people who are very cautious about verification.

On Twitter today, Aug 3, 2015, I asked people who knew Ed Snowden at work in the IC to get in touch so I can portray his work there honestly in my forthcoming book, Dark Mirror (Penguin Press). Here's a signed link to that message. As @drwdal pointed out, it's hard to verify Twitter messages out of band. If you're the person who has information, read gellman.us/pgp, use my SecureDrop landing page at tcfmailvault.info, or let me know what method you prefer.

For those who want to be very careful, and maybe you should be: I'm Bart Gellman and I approve this message. https://twitter.com/bartongellman/status/760841244704669697. Verify my key at gellman.us/pgp and https://keybase.io/bartongellman. Also note that @snowden gives his consent: https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/760871702259695616.
